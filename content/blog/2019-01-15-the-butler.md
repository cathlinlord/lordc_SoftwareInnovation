Hello! My name is Cathlin Lord and I am currently a senior at Allegheny College.
I am majoring in Environmental Science, with a focus in GIS, and double-minoring
in Computer Science and Global Health Studies. On campus I am research assistant
in the GIS lab, the Director of Sustainability and Environmental Affairs for
Allegheny Student Government, a Co-President of Allegheny Against Cancer, and a
member of Students for Environmental Action.

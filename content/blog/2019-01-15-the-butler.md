Hello! My name is Cathlin Lord and I am currently a senior at Allegheny College.
I am majoring in Environmental Science, with a focus in GIS, and double-minoring
in Computer Science and Global Health Studies. On campus I am research assistant
in the GIS lab, the Director of Sustainability and Environmental Affairs for
Allegheny Student Government, a Co-President of Allegheny Against Cancer, and a
member of Students for Environmental Action.

As I am soon leaving Allegheny College, due to graduating in May of 2020, I hope
to transition into a career that is focused or incorporates GIS. I would like
to apply all of my GIS skills that I have learned throughout my college career
to help protect our environment and help people make informed decisions.

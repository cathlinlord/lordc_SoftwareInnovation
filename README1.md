# Web Project Reflection

In order to complete my web project, I used a template of a static blog that is
powered through Cecil and Hyde. To deploy the website, Netlify was used. Using
a template made the task of building a website to display my work and career
trajectory, much easier. This allowed me reformat the template to be fitting
for my own materials. At the beginning of this process, I examined all of the
given files, to familiarize myself with what was included with the template and
how everything was connected. From there, I began to edit various parts of the
content to get a feel for how changes occurred, since my last experience with
creating a website was slightly different. Once I became comfortable with the
material I began to make larger changes, as my past experiences were coming back
to me. Throughout this process, I did face some challenges with
making the template my own. The main issues I faced were surrounding adding
visuals to various pages, such as documents or images. To over come these issues,
I added the documents as links and images had to be added in an image tag. The
format used for the template only was accepted for the home page and all other
pages required an image reference tag. The final issue I encountered was
incorporating Google Analytics to take visitors to my website. To allow Google
Analytics to run on my website, a script had to be added to my twig file and
had to include my UA number. 

My overall audience for this website is potential future employers that work
mainly within the field of Geographic information systems (GIS). This website
gives employers an option to learn about my GIS projects, while also seeing my
computer science skills put to use. I have set my website up, so that the focus
is very much on GIS, by putting anything related to GIS at the top of each page.
I also geared by bio to GIS employers by mentioning that is my focus as I start
my career.

Throughout the semester, I have had the opportunity to create several documents
that will help me when applying for jobs after graduation. These documents have
helped me determine what information should be included on my website and each
page and what order. The developer narrative influenced my bio, while my resume
and the feedback I got on it, influenced my skills, experience, education, and
projects pages. Creating these documents and then implementing them to a website
was a great way to practice for job applications and resulted in an additional
visual for potential employers.
